# dani's vimrc folder

This repository acts as a backup for my configuration files.
It also is a nice showcase of my configuration, which I'm proud of.
I know I'm a noob at Git but take anything you want from here.

## Install

Clone this repository to a folder named .vim:

```
git clone http://github.com/danirod/vimrc ~/.vim
```

For compatibility issues it's a good idea to create symlinks to
vimrc and gvimrc as ~/.vimrc and ~/.gvimrc:

```
cd ~
ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
ln -s .vim/gvimrc .gvimrc
```
